		<h2>Restaurants</h2>


		<p>It is not common to go out for dinner very often in Norway. You might
		think that the reason is that restaurants are usually quite expensive (which
		they are), but that's not the real reason. According to the typical Norwegian
		mentality, you are not supposed to show or think that you are better than
		anyone else, or to show that you have lots of money. This has to do with the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante">Law of Jante</a>. That's
		why most Norwegians don't really go out to eat often, but they actually do it
		when there is something to celebrate or it is a special occasion.</p>


		<p>Although it's not common, there's always nice to have in mind a few places
		to go celebrate a birthday or other events, or just enjoy a nice dinner with
		your new exchange friends. Below we leave you three recommendations of cheap
		restaurants where you could get some really nice food for a reasonable
		price.</p>
